summary: Full-featured Z-Wave Control Panel and MQTT Gateway.
description: |
  Full-featured Z-Wave Control Panel and MQTT Gateway compatible with all known 500 and 
  700 series Z-Wave controller hardware adapters, Z-Wave JS runs on almost anything with 
  a little bit of computing power and a serial port.

  # Main features
  - Control Panel UI: Directly control your nodes and their values from the UI, including:
    - Nodes management: Add, remove, and configure all nodes in your Z-Wave network
    - Firmware updates: Update device firmware using manufacturer-supplied firmware files
    - Groups associations: Add, edit, and remove direct node associations
    - Z-Wave JS Exposed: Provides full-access to Z-Wave JS's APIs
  - Full-Featured Z-Wave to MQTT Gateway: Expose Z-Wave devices to an MQTT broker in a 
    fully configurable manner
  - Secured: Supports HTTPS and user authentication
  - Scene Management: Create scenes and trigger them by using MQTT apis (with timeout 
    support)
  - Debug Logs in the UI: See debug logs directly from the UI
  - Access Store Files in the UI: Access the files are stored in the persistent store 
    folder directly from the UI
  - Network Graph: Provides a beautiful map showing how nodes are communicating with the 
    controller
  - Supports the Official Home Assistant Integration: Can act as the backend driver for 
    the official Home Assistant integration, using the same driver and socket server as 
    the official addon
  - Supports Home Assistant Discovery via MQTT: In lieu of the official integation, can 
    be used to expose Z-Wave devices to Home Assistant via MQTT discovery.
  - Supported by Domoticz (beta 2021.1): Using MQTT Autodiscovery.
  - Automatic/Scheduled backups: Scheduled backup of NVM and store directory. It's also 
    possible to enable automatic backups of NVM before every node inclusion/exclusion/
    replace, this ensures to create a safe restore point before any operation that can 
    cause a network corruption.

  ## Additions with the snap
  - Command to read the log from the terminal independent of if you're logging to file or not
  - Plugs for the `code-server` snap, if you want a full-fledge editor experience for the «store-folder»

  # Auto-connections
  - `raw-usb`: To access USB devices, such as Z-wave controller dongles
  - `hardware-observe`: To observe your system for devices, to easily find them in the UI

  **Note:** None of these connections are necessary to run the app, so you can disconnect them as you like, but please note that it might
    change the experience within the software.
